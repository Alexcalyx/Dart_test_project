# Attractivity app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

The Flutter application calculates a person's attractiveness score based on their input attributes like name, gender, age, height, weight, and fitness. 
The Person class contains methods to calculate individual scores for each attribute and generate an attractiveness message. 
The HomePage widget presents a form where users can input their details, and upon pressing the "Calculate" button, their attractiveness score is computed and displayed in a dialog. 
The user interface elements are built using Flutter's widgets, and the app follows a structured architecture to ensure a clear and intuitive user experience.
